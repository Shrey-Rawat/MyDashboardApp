# Training Features Implementation

This document outlines the training features that have been implemented as part of Step 9 of the development plan.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Workout Planner with Exercise Templates ✅

**Location**: `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/`

**Components**:
- **WorkoutPlannerScreen.kt**: Complete UI for creating and managing workout plans
- **WorkoutPlannerViewModel**: Handles workout creation logic
- **Exercise Database**: 20+ pre-defined exercises across categories
- **Template System**: Save workouts as reusable templates

**Features**:
- ✅ Exercise selection with search and filtering by category
- ✅ Drag-and-drop exercise ordering
- ✅ Template creation and management
- ✅ Exercise details with instructions and difficulty levels
- ✅ Multiple exercise categories: Strength, Cardio, Flexibility, Balance
- ✅ Equipment-based filtering

### 2. Live Session Tracker with Timer & Set Logging ✅

**Location**: `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/LiveSessionScreen.kt`

**Components**:
- **LiveSessionScreen.kt**: Real-time workout tracking interface
- **LiveSessionViewModel**: Manages workout state and timing
- **Timer System**: Workout duration and rest period tracking
- **Set Logging**: Weight, reps, duration, and distance tracking

**Features**:
- ✅ Real-time workout timer
- ✅ Exercise-by-exercise navigation
- ✅ Set logging with weight/reps/duration/distance
- ✅ Rest timer with customizable durations
- ✅ Exercise progress indicator
- ✅ Dynamic input fields based on exercise type (cardio vs strength)
- ✅ Set completion tracking

### 3. Progress Charts (1RM, Volume) using Compose Equivalents ✅

**Location**: `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/ProgressAnalyticsScreen.kt`

**Components**:
- **ProgressAnalyticsScreen.kt**: Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- **ProgressAnalyticsViewModel**: Data processing and analytics logic
- **Chart Components**: Utilizing existing Charts.kt components
- **Analytics Calculations**: 1RM estimation, volume tracking, personal records

**Features**:
- ✅ Workout summary statistics (total workouts, time, calories)
- ✅ Muscle group frequency bar charts
- ✅ Personal records tracking with gold medal icons
- ✅ 1-Rep Max progress line charts
- ✅ Volume progress tracking
- ✅ Time range filtering (week, month, 3 months, year)
- ✅ Exercise-specific analysis
- ✅ Animated chart transitions

## Architecture Implementation

### Data Layer ✅
- **TrainingRepository**: Complete repository pattern implementation
- **TrainingDao**: Database operations with analytics queries
- **Entity Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships between Workout, Exercise, Set, and WorkoutExerciseCrossRef
- **Sample Data**: 20 predefined exercises across all categories

### UI Layer ✅
- **Navigation**: Proper navigation graph with deep linking support
- **ViewModels**: Reactive state management with Hilt dependency injection
- **Compose UI**: Modern Material 3 design system
- **Accessibility**: Proper content descriptions and semantic markup

### Integration ✅
- **Database Module**: Updated to provide TrainingRepository
- **Navigation Integration**: Full integration with main app navigation
- **Chart Integration**: Utilizes existing chart components from core module

## Navigation Flow

```
Training Home Screen
├── Plan Workout → Workout Planner Screen
├── Start Workout → Live Session Screen
├── Analytics → Progress Analytics Screen
└── Templates → Quick start from saved templates
```

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Chart Library**: Used existing Compose-based charts from core module instead of MPAndroidChart for consistency
2. **State Management**: Implemented reactive state with Kotlin Flow and StateFlow
3. **Database Design**: Normalized schema with proper relationships for scalability
4. **Navigation**: Used Compose Navigation with type-safe routing
5. **Material 3**: Consistent design system with proper theming

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `data/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/data/repository/TrainingRepository.kt`
- `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/TrainingViewModels.kt`
- `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/WorkoutPlannerScreen.kt`
- `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/LiveSessionScreen.kt`
- `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/ProgressAnalyticsScreen.kt`
- `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/ui/TrainingHomeScreen.kt`
- `data/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/data/sample/SampleTrainingData.kt`

### Modified Files:
- `data/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/data/di/DatabaseModule.kt` - Updated to use new TrainingRepository
- `feature-training/src/main/kotlin/com/mydashboardapp/training/navigation/TrainingNavigation.kt` - Enhanced with full navigation graph

## Future Enhancements

While the core requirements are met, potential future enhancements include:

1. **Real-time Sync**: Cloud synchronization for workout data
2. **Social Features**: Workout sharing and community challenges
3. **AI Recommendations**: Intelligent workout suggestions based on performance
4. **Wearable Integration**: Heart rate monitoring and step tracking
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for performance prediction
6. **Offline Support**: Full offline functionality with sync when online

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes:
- ViewModel unit testing with mock repositories
- UI testing with Compose testing framework
- Repository testing with in-memory database
- Integration testing for navigation flows

All features have been implemented according to the requirements and are ready for integration testing and user acceptance testing.
