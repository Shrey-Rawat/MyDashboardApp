- ✅ Play Store metadata and changelog structure
- ✅ CI/CD validation script for local testing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 📋 Required GitHub Secrets Setup

You'll need to configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

### Release Signing Secrets
```
KEYSTORE_BASE64          # Base64-encoded release keystore file
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD        # Keystore password  
KEY_ALIAS               # Key alias name
KEY_PASSWORD            # Key password
```

### Play Store Deployment
```
GOOGLE_PLAY_API_KEY_JSON # Google Play Console service account JSON
```

### Optional Notifications  
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL        # Slack webhook for deployment notifications
```

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Release Signing
```bash
# Generate a release keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release-key

# Convert to base64 for GitHub Secrets
base64 -i release-keystore.jks
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
1. Go to repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Add all required secrets (see list above)
3. Ensure secrets are available to workflows

### 3. Set Up Play Store Integration
1. Create Google Cloud service account
2. Download JSON key file  
3. Grant Play Console API access
4. Register both app flavors:
   - `com.mydashboardapp.free`
   - `com.mydashboardapp.pro`

### 4. Test the Pipeline
```bash
# Run local validation
./scripts/validate-ci.sh

# Create a test release
git tag v1.0.0-test
git push origin v1.0.0-test
```
