- **Purpose**: Testing MCP server with GitHub Actions
- **Branch**: develop
- **Repository**: MyDashboardApp

## GitHub Actions Workflows Tested

1. **Build Workflow** - Tests Android app builds for multiple flavors and build types
2. **CI Workflow** - Comprehensive CI with unit tests, instrumentation tests, and static analysis 
3. **Test Workflow** - Focused testing including unit tests, integration tests, and screenshot tests
4. **Lint Workflow** - Code quality checks including Detekt, KtLint, Android Lint, dependency analysis
5. **Release Workflow** - Production release pipeline with Play Store deployment

## MCP Server Features Tested

- [x] Repository information retrieval (via GitHub CLI)
- [x] Workflow triggering (via Pull Request)
- [x] Pull request creation (PR #1 created)
- [x] Issue management (Issue #2 created)
- [x] File operations (multiple files created/edited)
- [x] Branch operations (develop branch used)
- [ ] Direct MCP tool execution (authentication issues)
- [ ] Release management
- [x] Workflow status monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Create pull request to main branch
2. Test MCP server pull request operations
3. Verify workflow triggering through MCP
4. Test issue creation and management
5. Validate file operations through MCP server
