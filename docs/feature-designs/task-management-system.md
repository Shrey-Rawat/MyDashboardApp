# Task Management System

## Overview

The Task Management System is the core productivity feature of the Best Productivity App. It provides users with comprehensive tools to create, organize, track, and complete tasks across different projects and contexts. The system integrates with other app features like time tracking, goal setting, and AI recommendations.

## User Stories

### Core Functionality

## Technical Requirements

### Data Models

#### Task Entity
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "tasks")
data class Task(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    val title: String,
    val description: String? = null,
    val projectId: String? = null,
    val priority: TaskPriority = TaskPriority.MEDIUM,
    val status: TaskStatus = TaskStatus.TODO,
    val dueDate: LocalDateTime? = null,
    val createdAt: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now(),
    val completedAt: LocalDateTime? = null,
    val parentTaskId: String? = null,
    val isRecurring: Boolean = false,
    val recurringPattern: RecurringPattern? = null,
    val tags: List<String> = emptyList(),
    val estimatedMinutes: Int? = null,
    val actualMinutes: Int? = null
)

enum class TaskPriority { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT }
enum class TaskStatus { TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, ARCHIVED }
```

#### Project Entity
```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "projects")
data class Project(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String = UUID.randomUUID().toString(),
    val name: String,
    val description: String? = null,
    val color: String = "#2196F3",
    val isArchived: Boolean = false,
    val createdAt: LocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.now()
)
```

### Database Operations

#### TaskDao
```kotlin
@Dao
interface TaskDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE status != 'ARCHIVED' ORDER BY dueDate ASC")
    fun getAllActiveTasks(): Flow<List<Task>>
    
    @Query("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE projectId = :projectId")
    fun getTasksByProject(projectId: String): Flow<List<Task>>
    
    @Query("SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE dueDate BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate")
    fun getTasksByDateRange(startDate: LocalDateTime, endDate: LocalDateTime): Flow<List<Task>>
    
    @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE)
    suspend fun insertTask(task: Task)
    
    @Update
    suspend fun updateTask(task: Task)
    
    @Delete
    suspend fun deleteTask(task: Task)
}
```

### Repository Layer

```kotlin
class TaskRepository @Inject constructor(
    private val taskDao: TaskDao,
    private val projectDao: ProjectDao
) {
    fun getAllTasks(): Flow<List<Task>> = taskDao.getAllActiveTasks()
    
    fun getTasksByProject(projectId: String): Flow<List<Task>> = 
        taskDao.getTasksByProject(projectId)
    
    suspend fun createTask(task: Task) = taskDao.insertTask(task)
    
    suspend fun updateTask(task: Task) = taskDao.updateTask(task)
    
    suspend fun markTaskComplete(taskId: String) {
        val task = taskDao.getTaskById(taskId)
        if (task != null) {
            taskDao.updateTask(
                task.copy(
                    status = TaskStatus.COMPLETED,
                    completedAt = LocalDateTime.now()
                )
            )
        }
    }
}
```

## UI/UX Design

### Screen Architecture

#### Task List Screen
- **Main View**: List of tasks with quick actions (complete, edit, delete)
- **Filtering**: Filter by project, priority, status, tags
- **Sorting**: Sort by due date, priority, creation date, alphabetical
- **Search**: Full-text search across task titles and descriptions
- **FAB**: Floating action button to create new tasks

#### Task Detail Screen
- **Editable Fields**: Title, description, project, priority, due date
- **Subtasks**: Add and manage subtasks
- **Time Tracking**: Start/stop timer, view logged time
- **Dependencies**: Link to other tasks
- **Comments**: Add notes and comments

#### Task Board View (Kanban)
- **Columns**: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED
- **Drag & Drop**: Move tasks between columns
- **Swim Lanes**: Group by project or priority

#### Calendar View
- **Monthly View**: Tasks displayed on due dates
- **Daily View**: Detailed day view with task scheduling
- **Integration**: Sync with device calendar (premium feature)

### UI Components

#### TaskCard Composable
```kotlin
@Composable
fun TaskCard(
    task: Task,
    onTaskClick: (Task) -> Unit,
    onCompleteClick: (Task) -> Unit,
    onEditClick: (Task) -> Unit,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    Card(
        modifier = modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .clickable { onTaskClick(task) },
        elevation = CardDefaults.cardElevation(defaultElevation = 2.dp)
    ) {
        // Task content implementation
    }
}
```

### Material Design 3 Integration
- **Color Scheme**: Use Material 3 color tokens
- **Typography**: Material 3 typography scale
- **Components**: Material 3 buttons, cards, inputs
- **Animations**: Shared element transitions between screens

## API Specifications

### REST API Endpoints (for cloud sync)

```
GET    /api/v1/tasks              # Get all tasks
POST   /api/v1/tasks              # Create new task
GET    /api/v1/tasks/{id}         # Get specific task
PUT    /api/v1/tasks/{id}         # Update task
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{id}         # Delete task

GET    /api/v1/projects           # Get all projects
POST   /api/v1/projects           # Create new project
PUT    /api/v1/projects/{id}      # Update project
DELETE /api/v1/projects/{id}      # Delete project
```

### Sync Strategy
- **Offline-First**: All operations work offline
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with user notification
- **Incremental Sync**: Only sync changed data
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for real-time collaboration (future)
