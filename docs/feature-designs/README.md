# Feature Design Documents

This directory contains detailed design documents for each major feature in the Best Productivity App. These documents provide comprehensive specifications for feature implementation, user experience, and technical architecture.

## Purpose

Feature design documents serve to:
- Document feature requirements and specifications before implementation
- Provide a reference for developers during implementation
- Enable design reviews and stakeholder feedback
- Track feature evolution and changes over time
- Facilitate cross-team coordination and understanding

## Document Structure

Each feature design document follows this template structure:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Overview
Brief description and purpose

## User Stories
User-focused requirements

## Technical Requirements
System and technical specifications

## UI/UX Design
User interface and experience specifications

## API Specifications
Data models and API contracts

## Implementation Plan
Development phases and milestones

## Testing Strategy
Testing approach and acceptance criteria
```
