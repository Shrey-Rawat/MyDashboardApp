# ADR-0003: Jetpack Compose for UI

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For the Best Productivity App UI implementation, we needed to choose between different Android UI frameworks. The app requires:

1. **Modern, Material 3 design** with consistent theming across all features
2. **Complex UI components** including charts, calendars, and interactive forms
3. **Dynamic UI updates** based on real-time data (timers, progress tracking)
4. **Accessibility support** for inclusive user experience
5. **Maintainable UI code** that can be easily modified and extended
6. **Performance** for smooth interactions and animations

The main options considered were:

1. **View System + Data Binding**: Traditional Android Views with data binding
2. **View System + ViewBinding**: Traditional Views with ViewBinding 
3. **Jetpack Compose**: Google's modern declarative UI toolkit
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Mix of Views and Compose for different screens

Additional considerations:
- Team expertise and learning curve
- Third-party library support
- Long-term maintenance and Google's strategic direction
- Performance characteristics for our use cases

## Decision
We have chosen **Jetpack Compose** as our primary UI framework with the following approach:

### Implementation Strategy
- **Pure Compose**: All new UI screens built with Compose
- **Material 3**: Full adoption of Material Design 3 components
- **Single Activity**: Navigation Compose with single Activity architecture
- **Custom Components**: Reusable Compose components in the `core` module
- **Accessibility**: Built-in Compose accessibility support
- **Legacy Support**: Interop with existing View-based libraries when needed

### Key Compose Features Utilized
- **Declarative UI**: State-driven UI updates
- **Custom Composables**: Reusable UI components across feature modules
- **Theming**: Centralized Material 3 theme in `core` module
- **Animation**: Built-in animation support for smooth transitions
- **State Management**: Integration with ViewModels and StateFlow

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Modern Development Experience**: Declarative syntax is more intuitive and less error-prone
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: No XML layouts, findViewById, or manual view updates
- **Better Performance**: Intelligent recomposition and built-in optimizations
- **Material 3 Support**: First-class support for latest Material Design components
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features with semantic properties
- **Future-Proof**: Google's strategic UI direction ensures long-term support
- **Testing**: Compose testing provides better UI testing capabilities
- **State Management**: Seamless integration with modern Android architecture components

### Negative  
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Compose concepts and best practices
- **Library Compatibility**: Some third-party libraries may not support Compose yet
- **Migration Complexity**: Any existing View-based code requires migration
- **Debugging**: Different debugging approach compared to traditional Views
- **Performance Monitoring**: Need to understand Compose performance characteristics

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Team Training**: Dedicated learning time for Compose fundamentals
- **Code Reviews**: Emphasize Compose best practices in reviews
- **Reusable Components**: Build comprehensive component library in `core` module
- **Documentation**: Document common patterns and component usage
- **Performance**: Use Compose performance tools and follow optimization guidelines
- **Interop Support**: Use View interop for essential third-party components when needed

### Impact on Architecture
- **Single Activity**: Simplified navigation with Navigation Compose
- **State Management**: Enhanced integration with ViewModels and State
- **Component Reusability**: Shared Composables across feature modules
- **Theming**: Centralized theme system with Material 3
- **Testing Strategy**: Compose-first testing approach

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Compose BOM**: Use Compose BOM for version alignment
- **Compiler Version**: Keep Compose compiler version in sync with Kotlin
- **Navigation**: Navigation Compose for all feature navigation
- **Accompanist**: Use Accompanist libraries for additional functionality
- **Preview Support**: Leverage Compose Preview for rapid development

### Performance Considerations
- **Recomposition**: Design Composables to minimize unnecessary recompositions
- **State Management**: Use appropriate state holders (remember, rememberSaveable)
- **LazyColumn/LazyRow**: For efficient list rendering
- **Animation**: Use Compose animations for smooth user interactions

This decision aligns with Google's strategic direction and provides a modern, maintainable foundation for our productivity app's user interface while enabling rapid development and consistent user experience across all features.
