# ADR-0001: Multi-Module Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Best Productivity App is designed to be a comprehensive productivity suite with multiple features including task management, nutrition tracking, fitness planning, financial management, and AI-powered recommendations. We needed to decide on the overall project structure that would:

1. **Support multiple development teams** working on different features simultaneously
2. **Enable feature modularity** where features can be developed, tested, and potentially distributed independently
3. **Optimize build performance** for large codebases
4. **Support premium feature gating** where certain modules can be conditionally included
5. **Maintain clear separation of concerns** between different functional areas
6. **Enable code sharing** for common functionality across features

The main architectural options considered were:

1. **Single Module (Monolithic)**: All code in a single Android module
2. **Feature-based Multi-Module**: Separate modules for each major feature
3. **Layer-based Multi-Module**: Modules separated by architectural layers
4. **Hybrid Multi-Module**: Combination of feature and layer separation

## Decision
We have chosen a **hybrid multi-module architecture** with the following structure:

### Core Infrastructure Modules
- **`app`**: Thin launcher module containing only MainActivity and Application class
- **`core`**: Shared utilities, theme, navigation helpers, and UI components
- **`data`**: Room database, repository implementations, and data models

### Feature Modules
- **`feature-productivity`**: Task management and productivity tools
- **`feature-nutrition`**: Nutrition tracking and meal planning
- **`feature-training`**: Workout tracking and fitness planning  
- **`feature-finance`**: Financial tracking and budgeting
- **`feature-inventory`**: Inventory and stock management
- **`feature-ai`**: AI-powered features and recommendations

### Supporting Modules
- **`auth`**: Authentication logic isolated behind interfaces
- **`billing`**: Google Play Billing integration for premium features
- **`sync`**: Cloud synchronization functionality (premium feature)
- **`export`**: Data export functionality

### Dependency Rules
- Feature modules depend only on `core` and `data`
- Feature modules cannot depend on each other directly
- All navigation between features goes through the `core` navigation system
- Premium features (`sync`, advanced `billing` features) are isolated

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work on different features without conflicts
- **Build Performance**: Gradle can build modules in parallel and cache unchanged modules
- **Feature Independence**: Features can be developed, tested, and released independently
- **Premium Feature Support**: Easy to conditionally include/exclude premium modules
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined interfaces between modules prevent tight coupling
- **Code Reuse**: Common functionality is centralized in `core` and `data` modules
- **Testing Isolation**: Each module can be tested in isolation with minimal dependencies

### Negative
- **Initial Complexity**: More complex setup compared to single module
- **Navigation Complexity**: Cross-feature navigation requires more coordination
- **Dependency Management**: Need to carefully manage dependencies between modules
- **Build Configuration**: More Gradle configuration required (mitigated by convention plugins)
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand module boundaries and communication patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradle Convention Plugins**: Standardize module configuration and reduce boilerplate
- **Clear Documentation**: Document module responsibilities and dependency rules
- **Navigation API**: Centralized navigation system in `core` for cross-feature navigation
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt manages cross-module dependencies cleanly
- **Interface-based Design**: Use interfaces for cross-module communication

### Impact on Development
- Development teams can work more independently
- CI/CD can build and test modules separately
- Code reviews can focus on specific functional areas
- Feature flags and A/B testing are easier to implement
- App size can be optimized by excluding unused features

This architecture supports our goals of building a scalable, maintainable productivity app that can grow with our team and user needs while maintaining high code quality and build performance.
